# ngBoilerplate Modusified

A (differently) opinionated kickstarter for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) projects.

- Uses SASS instead of LESS ([grunt-sass](https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-sass) so no Ruby dependency)
- Replaces `ngmin` with [`ngAnnotate`](https://github.com/olov/ng-annotate)
- Removes support for CoffeeScript
- Includes Angular [UI's Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) and Bootstrap libraries, as well as FontAwesome and Lo-Dash


##TODO
* Update license to provide attribution to ngbp w/o implying entire code base is copywritten to @joshdmiller
* Expect to expand upon libraries used once I get a better feel for our typical usage
* Integrate Broccoli
* Figure out plan for integrating new releases from ng-boilerplate proper

##Further Reading
See [ngBoilerplate](http://joshdmiller.github.com/ng-boilerplate) for more information.
