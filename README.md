# ngBoilerplate Modusified

A (differently) opinionated kickstarter for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) projects.

- Uses SASS instead of LESS ([grunt-sass](https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-sass) so no Ruby dependency)
- Removes support for CoffeeScript
- Includes Angular UI's Router and Bootstrap libraries, as well as FontAwesome and Lo-Dash


##TODO
* Update license to provide attribution to ngbp w/o implying entire code base is copywritten to @joshdmiller
* Expect to expand upon libraries used once I get a better feel for our typical usage
* Integrate Broccoli
* Figure out plan for integrating new releases from ng-boilerplate proper
